### Course Syllabus
[Syllabus](COSC%207336%20Fall%202017%20syllabus.pdf)

### Course goal
The goal of the course is to study deep learning models, i.e. neural networks with several layers,  and their application to solve challenging natural language analysis problems. The course will cover the  foundations of deep learning models as well as the practical issues associated with their design, implementation, training and deployment. A hands-on approach will be used through the course focused on solving different text analysis and understanding tasks motivated by real world problems. 

### Prerequisites
The course assumes students have taken COSC 6336 or an equivalent itroductory course to NLP. The course assumes knowledge and understanding of machine learning basic concepts, such as those studied in an introductory machine learning or data mining class, as well as knowledge of fundamental concepts of linear algebra and probability theory. The course also requires familiarity with programming in Python, as there will be several practical assignments.
