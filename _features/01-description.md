### Course Syllabus
[Syllabus](COSC%207336%20Fall%202017%20syllabus.pdf)

### Course goal
The goal of the course is to study artificial chemistries, i.e. virtual particles interaction,  and their application to simulate reactions as a computational process. The course will cover the  foundations of artificial chemistries as well as the practical issues associated with their design, implementation, simulation and analysis. A hands-on approach will be used through the course focused on simulating and understanding tasks motivated by understand the principal rules to simulate chemistries on computational platform. 

### Prerequisites
The course requires familiarity with programming in Python and Java, as there will be several practical assignments.
