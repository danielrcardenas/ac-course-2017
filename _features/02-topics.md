The course has a propose to give some concepts about particle self-assembly by using computational tools like Artficial Chemistries (AC). The AC is a tools to simulate chemical reactions processes. Those chemical reactions generates the self-assembling of molecules from particles. The will be capable to recreate chemical models on a simulation to represent natural phenomenon like, self-assembly-, self-organization and self-replication. The stufen should make a presentation about topics, create computational simulations and develop a final proyect focusen on an engineering problem.
